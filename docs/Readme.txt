What is Algorithm Elf anyway?
-----------------------------

A graphical way to show the implementation process of the most data structure algorithms. Applicable to the production of algorithms course and help the students understanding of the software algorithm for the implementation process.

Algorithm elf uses the animation way to show memory data, heap stack data changes in an intuitive display that can help you understand the algorithm implementation. The process of these animations can be extracted to design courseware material.

Most of the classical algorithm is built-in . Each algorithm can be used as a game. In the course of the game, you need set the image attributes, or fill in the correct data values by the algorithms, so he can continue the game or have the points (the game features in the current version has not yet achieved).

Algorithm wizard also allows you to write your algorithms in Pascal Language, build and run the algorithm. Through the graphical Algorithm-based approach to demonstrate the implementation process, to discover problems in algorithm design and better improved algorithm. you can add breakpoints and watchpoints in the execution process even.

Supported platforms 
------------------- 

Algorithm Elf is developed using the Python, so what's the
Python supported platforms are all the products
support. 

The following operation systems have been tested:
- Windows XP, 2000, 2003 
- GNU Linux(rh4) 

Installation 
------------

1. Windows Platforms

Downlowad the distributed packate from 
http://www.dashingsoft.com click products -> Algorithm Elf

You can get the latested version such as:

algorithm-elf-X.Y.M.N.exe

X.Y.M.N stands for the version information.

Double-click the installer package, follow the prompts to
complete the installation.

2. Linux Platforms
Downlowad the distributed packate from 
http://www.dashingsoft.com click products -> Algorithm Elf

You can get the latested version such as:
algorithm-elf-1.2.2-1.i686-linux.rpm
algorithm-elf-1.2.2.tar.gz
algorithm-elf-1.2.2.tar.bz2

After you get the rpm package, run the following command to install

$ rpm -ivh algorithm-elf-1.2.2-1.i686-linux.rpm

Be sure you have privilege enough.

you can run it by the following command:

$ cd /usr/algorithm-elf
$ ./algorithm-elf.bin

You can uninstall it by running the folloing command

$ rpm -e algorithm-elf

If you're customed to use the tar file to install the
application, download the file then:

$ tar xzf algorithm-elf-1.2.2.tar.gz
$ cd algorithm-elf
$ ./algorithm-elf.bin

Main Features 
-------------
    > Algorithm Animation, as well as the view of stack
      changing and source code.

    > Step by step to show the implementation of algorithm.

    > Using datapool to configure the initial parameters of
      each algorithm.

    > Input the tree, graph of the parameters by the
      graphical style.

    > Replay the animation process of algorithm
      implementation.

    > The algorithms have been implemented: 
          * Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm 
          * Binary Tree Traversal 
          * Build a thread binary tree.
          * Prime algorithm 
          * Straight Sort 
          * Bubble Sort 
          * Merging Sort 

    > You can add new algorithm written by pascal, build it
      and play it. And you can debug the algorithm, set the
      breakpoints and watchpoints. Algorithm Elf can
      displays the data changes in the implementation
      process, using an intuitive way of showing the problem
      of algorithm.

    > Multi-platform support, now internationalization of
      Chinese and English only.

Future features: 

    > You can forward and backward the algorithm implementation process.

    > Animation process can be saved as a file. 

    > Can be customized visualization of the shape and style of view. 

New or changed features
-----------------------
1.2.2:
  > Hide the console window when application startup;
  > Add global heaps when running algorithm;

1.2.1:
  > Highligt Syntax, Smart Completion in the editor
  > Debug the algorithm, set the breakpoints and watchpoints.
  > A new feature Datapool is found in this version, it used
    to manage the algorithm parameters.

1.2.0.119:

  > Add pascal parse, it can parse the algorithm written by
    pascal to the python file which can animate the process
    of algorithm implementation.
  > Input the tree, grpah of the parameters by the graphical sytle. 

1.1.0.59:

  > Add a balloon window to show the source code in the call stack.
  > View the local variable by the balloon.
  > The stack view is simplified to show the current
    context, not all the contexts.
  > Add the features of zoom in and zoom out.
  > Support Linux platform.

  Fixed Issues
  > Step mode has been implemented perfectly.
  > Unicode issuse have been fixed.
  > The incorrect display in the Hanoi Algorithm has been
    resolved.
